<p>Using Spotify’s API, wraped via the <strong>spotifyr</strong> package, let’s retrieve the duration (in miliseconds) and popularity of the tracks.</p>

<p>There is a limit to how many track info requests we can make via <strong>one</strong> call using the <code>spotifyr::get_tracks</code> function. For that reason, I’ll make requests in groups of 50 tracks, until completing all tracks.</p>
<p>The following code chunk can be executed in the console, but it does not compile when rendering this Quarto file. I’ll save the new dataset obtained and simply load it afterwards.</p>

<p>Despite track’s duration and popularity being registered as numeric variables, a scatter plot does not reveal useful informacion.</p>
<p>Also note that the tracks popularity <em>median</em>, 1, is <strong>extremely close</strong> to its minimum possible value, <span class="math inline">\(0\)</span>. Therefore, I’ll consider a categorical transformation of the popularity simply via the intervals <span class="math inline">\([0, 1]\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\((1, 100]\)</span></p>

<li><p>More than half of the songs in my library last less than 5 minutes. That’s certainly unexpected.</p></li>
<li><p>Almost half of the songs from my library have a Spotify popularity of zero, the smalles value possible.</p></li>
<li><p>I expected that almost all of the <strong>non-popular songs</strong> in my library would be from Jazz, but, due to the Jazz songs I usually listen to, that would imply that the median duration of my library’s non-popular songs is much greater than the median duration of my library’s popular songs; which does not match reality.<br>
It may be useful to solve such <strong>mistery</strong> via analizing which <strong>music genres</strong> are my library’s non popular songs from.</p></li>
<li><p>Due to these findings, let’s retrieve more data about the tracks:</p>
<ul>
<li>Album release date (approximate track release date)</li>
<li>Track artist’s genres</li>
<li>Track artist’s popularity</li>
<li>Track artist’s number of Spotify followers this may require me retrieve the <strong>Spotify album identifier</strong> for each track, which I’ll use to retrieve the album release date; besides the <strong>Spotify artist identifer</strong>, which I’ll use to retrieve the artist’s musical genres, their popularity and their number of followers.</li>

<p>Source: <a href="https://rpubs.com/PeterDola/SpotifyTracks" class="uri">https://rpubs.com/PeterDola/SpotifyTracks</a></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Acousticness</strong>: Numerical, Confidence measure from 0.0 to 1.0 of whether the track is acoustic. 1.0 represents high confidence the track is acoustic.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Danceability</strong>: Numerical, danceability describes how suitable a track is for dancing based on a combination of musical elements including tempo, rhythm stability, beat strength, and overall regularity. A value of 0.0 is least danceable and 1.0 is most danceable.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Duration_ms</strong>: Numerical, the duration of the track in milliseconds.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Energy</strong>: Numerical, Energy is a measure from 0.0 to 1.0 and represents a perceptual measure of intensity and activity. Typically, energetic tracks feel fast, loud, and noisy. For example, death metal has high energy, while a Bach prelude scores low on the scale. Perceptual features contributing to this attribute include dynamic range, perceived loudness, timbre, onset rate, and general entropy.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Id</strong>: The Spotify ID for the track.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Instrumentalness</strong>: Numerical, predicts whether a track contains no vocals. “Ooh” and “aah” sounds are treated as instrumental in this context. Rap or spoken word tracks are clearly “vocal”. The closer the instrumentalness value is to 1.0, the greater likelihood the track contains no vocal content. Values above 0.5 are intended to represent instrumental tracks, but confidence is higher as the value approaches 1.0.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Liveness</strong>: Numerical, detects the presence of an audience in the recording. Higher liveness values represent an increased probability that the track was performed live. A value above 0.8 provides strong likelihood that the track is live.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Loudness</strong>: Numerical, Overall loudness of a track in decibels (dB). Loudness values are averaged across the entire track and are useful for comparing relative loudness of tracks. Loudness is the quality of a sound that is the primary psychological correlate of physical strength (amplitude). Values typical range between -60 and 0 db.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Popularity</strong>: Numerical, the popularity of a track is a value between 0 and 100, with 100 being the most popular. The popularity is calculated by algorithm and is based, in the most part, on the total number of plays the track has had and how recent those plays are.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Release_date</strong>: Date the song was released.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Speechiness</strong>: Numerical, speechiness detects the presence of spoken words in a track. The more exclusively speech-like the recording (e.g.&nbsp;talk show, audio book, poetry), the closer to 1.0 the attribute value. Values above 0.66 describe tracks that are probably made entirely of spoken words. Values between 0.33 and 0.66 describe tracks that may contain both music and speech, either in sections or layered, including such cases as rap music. Values below 0.33 most likely represent music and other non-speech-like tracks.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Tempo</strong>: Numerical, Overall estimated tempo of a track in beats per minute (BPM). In musical terminology, tempo is the speed or pace of a given piece and derives directly from the average beat duration.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Valence</strong>: Numerical, Measure from 0.0 to 1.0 describing the musical positiveness conveyed by a track. Tracks with high valence sound more positive (e.g.&nbsp;happy, cheerful, euphoric), while tracks with low valence sound more negative (e.g.&nbsp;sad, depressed, angry).</p></li>

<p>Before categorizing the tracks by music genre, let’s explore the proportions of the genres in the dataset.</p>
<p><strong>Note from the future:</strong> The genre <em>hip-hop</em> is labelled as <em>hip hop</em> in this dataset, but this creates a slight confusion with other genres which incude <em>hop</em> yet not <em>hip</em>.<br>
We can deal with this via replacing <em>hip hop</em> with <em>hip-hop</em>.</p>

<p>Note that the genre’s proportions are too spread out. Besides, many genres are similar, for example, jazz saxophone and jazz trumpet. For that reason, I’ll recategorize the <code>lib_genres</code> variable via the <strong>types</strong> of genres, considering the <strong>most common genre types</strong>, via counting the ocurrence of the words (<code>c("jazz", "saxophone")</code>, for example) in each genre from the <code>lib_genres</code>, into the <strong>nonunique</strong> genres from <code>lib_genres</code>. Judging from the types of genres in <code>lib_genres</code>, separating the words via a <strong>space</strong>, instead of a dash (-), seems appropriate.</p>

<p>Note that genres type like <strong>saxophone</strong> may seem in high proportion if such type only happes (in this dataset) for jazz songs. In such case, a genre type cateogry of <em>saxophone</em> would not make much sense … it should be a <strong>jazz</strong> category instead.</p>
<p>To shed light on this, let’s calculate the proportion of genre <em>types</em> among all <strong>unique</strong> genres in the tracks dataset.</p>

<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="conclusions">Conclusions</h4>
<p>After exploring the previous interactive graphics, these are my findings/conclusions, by data comparison:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>
Boxplot
</p>
<dl>
<dt>
acousticness vs genre_category
</dt>
<dd>
Apart from the <strong>Not assigned</strong> and <strong>jazz</strong> genre categories, all tracks from my Spotify 2022 library have very low acousticness.
</dd>
<dt>
album.release_year vs genre_category
</dt>
<dd>
The tracks from my Spotify 2022 library which were released before the year 2000, tend to be exclusively from the <strong>jazz</strong> genre category.
</dd>
<dt>
energy vs genre_category
</dt>
<dd>
The <strong>low energy</strong> tracks from my Spotify 2022 library tend to be exclusively from the <strong>Not assigned</strong> or <strong>jazz</strong> genre categories.
</dd>
<dt>
popularity vs genre_category
</dt>
<dd>
All of the tracks from my Spotify 2022 library have tend to have very low popularity. Besides this, the tracks from the genre categories <strong>Not assigned</strong>, <strong>indie</strong>, <strong>alternative</strong> or <strong>jazz</strong> tend to have <strong>extremely low popularity</strong>.
</dd>
</dl>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Scatter plot
</p>
<dl>
<dt>
acousticness vs energy
</dt>
<dd>
The graph reveals a clear <strong>negative correlation</strong> (-0.82) between acousticness and energy. This is consistent with the findings from these boxplots: acousticnes vs genre_category and energy vs genre_category.
</dd>
<dt>
acousticness vs loudness
</dt>
<dd>
The graph reveals a clear <strong>negative correlation</strong> (-0.67) between acousticness and loudness, with a <strong>stronger linear relationship</strong> than in the acousticness vs energy scatter plot.
</dd>
<dt>
artist.popularity vs artist.number_of_followers
</dt>
<dd>
The graph greatly resembles an increasing <strong>exponential function</strong>. The correlation between the artist.popularity and the natural logarithm of the artist.number_of_followers is 0.69.
</dd>
<dt>
energy vs loudness
</dt>
<dd>
Not only does the graph reveal a clear <strong>positive correlation</strong> (0.82) between energy and loudness, it also seems to trace a <strong>cubic polynomial</strong> shape.
</dd>
<dt>
valence vs danceability
</dt>
<dd>
The graph reveals a <strong>positive correlation</strong> (0.49) between valence and danceability, which is to be expected, because <em>happy</em>songs (high valence) tend to me more <em>danceable</em> (high danceability).<br>
However, at least in my case, I expected a <strong>negative correlation</strong> between valence and danceability, due to the fact that I don’t listen to many <em>danceable</em> songs, the exception being mainly <strong>Tango</strong> songs, which are usually <em>sad</em> (low valence) … I don’t listen to <em>happy Tango</em> (milonga).<br>
Note that the tracks from my Spotify 2022 library which include <strong>Tango</strong> as a genre type represent only <span class="math inline">\(0.11\)</span>% of the total number of library tracks. Therefore, such a small percentage of <em>low valence high danceability</em> tracks (assuming Spotify correctly assigned such numbers) explains the <strong>positive correlation</strong> obtained, instead of the <strong>negation correlation</strong> expected.

Bar plot
</p>
<dl>
<dt>
album.release_year_category vs popularity_levels
</dt>
<dd>
Among every category of the album’s release year, more than half of the tracks in such categories were non popular (popularity between 0 and 24).
</dd>
<dt>
album.release_year_category vs genre_category
</dt>
<dd>
<ul>
<li>Virtually zero tracks (precisely 2) from my Spotify 2022 library whose album was released between 1957 and 2010 have a pop genre category. <!-- 
  lib_tracks |>
    filter(genre_category == "pop") |>
    filter(album.release_year_category %in% c("[1957,2002]", "(2002,2010]")) |>
    count()
--></li>
<li>The percentage (among each category of the albums’ release year) of tracks with jazz genre category was highest (60.3%) for the oldest time period (<code>[1957,2002]</code>), and lowest (21.0%) for the most recent time period (<code>(2015,2022]</code>). <!-- 
  lib_tracks |>
    group_by(album.release_year_category) |>
    summarise(jazz_percentage_0_100 = 100 * prop.table(table(genre_category))["jazz"]) 
--></li>
<li>The more recent the album release year category, the more diverse becomes the genre categories of the tracks.</li>
</ul>
</dd>
<dt>
popularity_levels vs genre_category
</dt>
<dd>
One may expect that among the most popular songs one listens to, the majority of them are pop, due to the popularity, by definition, of such genre. In my case, that pattern does <strong>not occur</strong>.<br>
Among the most popular (popularity between 24 and 85) tracks in my Spotify 2022 library, only <span class="math inline">\(4.17\)</span>% of them had pop as genre type. <!-- 
  temp_df <- lib_tracks |>
    group_by(popularity_levels) |>
    summarise(n_tracks = n()) |>
    arrange(popularity_levels)
  for (genre_cat in unique(lib_tracks$genre_category)) {
    temp_df <<- merge(temp_df, 
      lib_tracks |>
        group_by(popularity_levels) |>
        summarise({{genre_cat}} := table(genre_category)[genre_cat]) |>
        arrange(popularity_levels)
    )
  }
  # Genre type percentage across popularity levels 
  mutate(temp_df, across(alternative:pop, \(x) 100 * x / n_tracks))
-->
</dd>
<dt>
popularity_levels vs album.release_year_category
</dt>
<dd>
I suspected that, among the non popular tracks (popularity between 0 and 1), the majority of them would have had their album year in the oldest category (<code>[1957, 2002]</code>). This due to my believe that the non popular tracks would be old jazz songs.<br>
<!--
  lib_tracks |>
    filter(genre_category == "jazz") |>
    group_by(album.release_year_category) |>
    summarise(percent_across_all_tracks = 
      100 * n() / nrow(filter(lib_tracks, genre_category == "jazz"))
    )
--> However, among the non popular tracks (popularity between 0 and 1), <span class="math inline">\(40.4\)</span>% of them are from <code>(2002,2010]</code>, and only <span class="math inline">\(20.6\)</span>% of them are from the oldest period (<code>[1957, 2002]</code>). <!-- 
  lib_tracks |>
    filter(popularity_levels == "[0,1]") |>
    group_by(album.release_year_category) |>
    summarise(percentage = 
      100 * n() / nrow(filter(lib_tracks, popularity_levels == "[0,1]"))
    ) |>
    arrange(desc(percentage))
-->
</dd>
<dt>
genre_category vs album.release_year_category
</dt>
<dd>
Among all genre categories, the percentage of <strong>old tracks</strong> (tracks whose album was released between 1957 and 2002) is <strong>smaller</strong> than <span class="math inline">\(30\)</span>%, except only for the <em>jazz genre type</em>, where such percentage is approximately <span class="math inline">\(40\)</span>%. <!-- 
  lib_tracks |>
    group_by(genre_category) |>
    summarise(old_songs_percent_across_genre = ifelse(
      is.na(table(album.release_year_category)["[1957,2002]"]),
      0,
      100 * prop.table(table(album.release_year_category))["[1957,2002]"]
    )) |>

Typically, energetic tracks feel fast, loud, and noisy. For example, death metal has high energy, while a Bach prelude scores low on the scale. Perceptual features contributing to this attribute include dynamic range, perceived loudness, timbre, onset rate, and general entropy.</span>

Rap or spoken word tracks are clearly “vocal”. The closer the instrumentalness value is to 1.0, the greater likelihood the track contains no vocal content. Values above 0.5 are intended to represent instrumental tracks, but confidence is higher as the value approaches 1.0.</span>
